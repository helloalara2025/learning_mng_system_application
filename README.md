**Data flow:** React components dispatch Redux actions → Axios API clients (with credentials) → Express REST routes → Mongoose DAOs → MongoDB Atlas

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React 18, Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Axios, Bootstrap, React Icons
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, Mongoose, express-session
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)
**Auth:** Session-based with secure cookies (SameSite, HTTPS in production)

## Run It Locally

**Backend:**
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env        # fill in your MongoDB connection string
npm install
npm run dev                  # runs on localhost:4000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER=http://localhost:4000" > .env.local
npm run dev                  # runs on localhost:3000
```

## API Endpoints

| Resource | Methods | Auth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/api/users` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, signin/signout | Session |
| `/api/courses` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | Session (faculty for writes) |
| `/api/courses/:cid/modules` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | Session |
| `/api/courses/:cid/quizzes` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, publish | Session |
| `/api/courses/:cid/quizzes/:qid/questions` | POST, PUT, DELETE | Session |
| `/api/courses/:cid/quizzes/:qid/attempts` | GET, POST, PUT, submit | Session |
| `/api/users/:uid/enrollments` | GET | Session |
| `/api/users/current/courses/:cid` | POST (enroll), DELETE (unenroll) | Session |

## Highlights

- **Full-stack ownership** — designed and built both the API layer and the React frontend from scratch
- **State management** — Redux Toolkit slices keep client state in sync with the database across courses, modules, quizzes, enrollments, and auth
- **Role-based access** — faculty can create/edit/delete courses and quizzes; students can browse, enroll, and take quizzes
- **Quiz engine** — supports multiple question types, attempt tracking, auto-save during attempts, and submission with grading
- **Session auth** — secure cookie-based sessions with CORS credentials, configured for both local dev and cross-origin production deployment
